I've been alone with you
Inside my mind
And in my dreams I've kissed your lips
A thousand times (f)
I sometimes see you (f)
Pass outside my door (f)

Hello!
pause(2)
Is it me you're looking for? (f)
pause(1)
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide (f)
'cause you know just what to say (f)
And you know just what to do (f)
And I want to tell you so much (f)
pause(2)
I love you
pause(5)
I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again
How much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow

Hello! (f)

Is it me you're looking for? (f)
