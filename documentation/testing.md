# Testing

We use Mocha for testing.  

The future goal is to have tests that cover 100% of the project.  

All tests can be found in the test directory.  

### Executing tests

Travis ci will run the tests after every commit.  

But if you want to execute them manually use this command:  

```
npm test
```

Npm will get the test property from package.json and run that command.
