## class names

We have split the classes of html elements in two categories.

The name of classes used to style elements are not prefixed. Class names used by javascript code have the js prefix.

Don't use "js classes" to style elements and don't non prefixed classes in your javascript code to identify elements.

This allows designers to remove or add classes without having to bother about braking javascript code and vis versa allows front end developers to remove or add classes used by their code.
